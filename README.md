A simple, functioanl, strongly typed programming language built using only 15 keywords

- Delimitators:
`() {} [] : ; . , + - * / % > = < " ' ? @`
- For comment use `#`
- Operators:
`+ - * / % > < == >= <= & | ! != ? @`
- For reference we use `@`. It's basically a pointer
- For checking if a reference is valid or not, we use `?` before the reference, if it is valid, it returns `true` else it returns `false`.
- Keywords:
`true`, `false` , `if` , `else` , `fxn` , `while` , `break` , `continue` , `import`, `return` , `num` , `str` , `bool` , `null` , `export`

- Strings and escaped characters in the are resolved at compile time itself
- Numbers are 64 bit floating point numbers and are also resolved at compile time.
